Performance = 1 / Execution Time

"X is N times faster than Y"
PerformanceX / PerformanceY = Execution Time Y / Execution Time X = N

Clock period = Duration of a cycle
Clock frequency / Clock rate = Cycles per second

CPU Time = Clock Cycles * Clock Cycle Time = Clock Cycles / Clock Rate

Clock Cycles = Instruction Count (IC) * Cycles per Instruction (CPI)

CPU Time = IC * CPI * Clock Cycle Time = IC * CPI / Clock Rate

Clock Cycles = SUM(CPIi * ICi)

CPI = Clock Cycles / IC = SUM(CPIi * IC)/SUM(ICs)

CPU Time = Instructions/Program * Clock cycles/Instruction * Seconds/Clock cycle

Power = Capacitive * Voltage^2 * Frequency

Amdahls: T improved = T affected / factor + T unaffected

Millions of Instructions Per Second
MIPS = IC / Execution Time e6 = IC / (IC*CPI/Clock Rate)e6 = Clock Rate / CPIe6
